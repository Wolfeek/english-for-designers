# “ADHD”

When I receive reactions to the word **“ADHD”**, I feel like a liar, a fake, and a fool all at once. I experience the same emotions when people react to me waiting for an Asperger’s diagnosis.

I don’t understand those people. Where do they get the confidence to comment on an issue they know nothing about? Even we, people with **“ADHD”** (or ADD, don’t judge someone with the same diagnosis based on our own experiences. Just because something doesn’t bother us, it doesn’t mean it doesn’t bother someone else who has the same diagnosis. We should remember: different people with the same condition may have different problems. There isn’t the only one type of **“ADHD”**. The same applies to other diagnoses, such as Asperger’s syndrome. Each of us has a unique range or combination of symptoms, and as a result, a unique level of difficulty in life. Someone may have a mild form, while someone else may have a severe form. I know someone who ended up in a mental institution due to a lack of diagnosis. Without strong medication for their ADHD, they would still be there today. When I mention **“ADHD”** to someone, who knows nothing about it, their reactions are often the same. “Here we go again - the three letters.” (which I don’t understand, there are actually four letters). “It’s only a trend at the moment. Everyone seems to have it.” “Such a thing does not exist. Only children have it. You'd grow out of it. Some people say you, that you can’t have **ADHD** if you’re girl or a woman. We also hear these incorrect beliefs from psychiatrists when we seek a diagnosis. These psychiatrists have limited education.

Every time I hear these reactions, I sense a surge of anger inside. I ask myself “What kind of generation are we, uttering things we have no right to comment on when we know nothing about the subject?

These reactions makes me feel like the pretender and the troublemaker.

A while ago, I stopped wanting to be like everyone else. It is beyond my capabilities. I wanted to be like others, so I took medication for **“ADHD.”** As a result, I ended up being on antidepressants for 7 years. Yes, those pills were supposed to help and ease my daily life, but I am worse off than before. If it weren’t for societal expectations, I would have never tried this medication. I perceive like others pushed me into it, and it feels like I ruined my life because of it. As a result of after depression, I also lost most of my friends. That’s why it destroys me when I hear these or worse reactions about **“ADHD”** instead of support. I worry that such words spoken by others could lead to harmful decisions for someone else.

At present, but, I know that I won’t let people and their opinions on these topics bring me down. They can think whatever they want. It won’t hurt me anymore. Even though I fight my demons every day and nobody sees how difficult life with **“ADHD”** is. I have finally reached a point where I am starting to love myself as I am. Try to understand health or neurological problems. Be compassionate towards those you don’t understand. Keep an open mind about these issues. It could have consequences.

**“Just…”**

As in “**Just** update your ruby gems, generate a new SSH key, and run a git rebase…“

“**Just** clone the dev branch, add those three grunt tasks, and recompile…”

“**Just** use this software, platform, toolkit, method…”

“Just” makes me feel like an idiot. “Just” presumes I come from a specific background and studied certain courses in university. And fluent in certain technologies. And have read all the right books, articles, and resources. “Just” is a dangerous word.

We approach problems equipped with our own set of experiences, perspective, and skills. It’s a struggle to step outside of our own perspective when communicating with others, but it’s essential to do so.

The amount of available knowledge in our field (or any field) is growing larger, more complex, and more segmented all the time. That everyone has downloaded the same fundamental knowledge on any topic is becoming less and less probable. Because of this, we have to be careful not to make too many assumptions in our documentation, blog posts, tutorials, and communications.

Imagine yourself explaining a particular task to an earlier version of yourself. Once upon a time, you didn’t know what you know now. Provide context. The beauty of [hypertext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext) is that we’re able to add much-needed context, fast. It’s helpful for newbies but easy enough for those already in-the-know to scan over. And making documentation more human-readable benefits everyone.

I don’t envy those just entering the field of web development. Besides learning the basics, there’s an expectation to be proficient in an endless laundry list of buzzwords and technologies. I’m seven years into my career and still feel like I’m still on Chapter 1 of the Big Book of Web Design.

So think twice before suggesting someone “just” [insert any task here]. You just might make them feel like an idiot.
