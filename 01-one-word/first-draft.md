# ADHD

When I receive reactions to the word “ADHD”, I feel like a liar, a fake, and a fool all at once. I experience the same emotions when people react to me waiting for an Asperger’s diagnosis.

I don’t understand those people. Where do they get the confidence to comment on an issue they know nothing about? Even we, people with “ADHD” (or ADD), don’t judge someone with the same diagnosis solely based on our own experiences. Just because something doesn’t trouble us, doesn’t mean it doesn’t trouble someone else with the same diagnosis. There isn’t just one type of “ADHD”. The same applies to other diagnoses, such as Asperger’s syndrome. Each of us has a unique range or combination of symptoms, and as a result, a unique level of difficulty in life. Someone may have a mild form, while someone else may have a severe form. I know someone who ended up in a mental institution due to a lack of diagnosis, and without strong medication for their ADHD, they would still be there today.
Whenever I mention “ADHD” to someone who knows nothing about it (which is most people who are not affected by it, but sadly even some family members of people with ADHD), their reactions are quite similar: “Again - the three letters.” (which I don’t understand, there are actually four letters). “It’s just a trend now. Everyone seems to have it.” “Such a thing does not exist. Only children have it. You'd grow out of it. You can’t have it if you are a girl or a woman” (We even hear these mystifications from certain not very educated psychiatrists during our attempts at diagnosis.)

Whenever I hear these reactions, I quietly rage inside and think to myself, “What kind of generation are we, uttering things we have no right to comment on when we know nothing about the subject?”

These reactions makes me feel like the pretender and the troublemaker.

A while ago, I stopped wanting to be like everyone else. Firstly, it is beyond my capabilities. Secondly, my desire to be like others led me to take medication for “ADHD,” which eventually led to 7 years on antidepressants. And yes, I am worse off than before those pills, which were meant to help and ease my daily life. If it weren’t for societal expectations, opinions, and judgment of who is and isn’t “normal,” I wouldn’t have tried these medications. I ruined my life because of the medication and it feels like I was pushed into it by others. As a result of subsequent depression, I also lost most of my friends. That’s why it destroys me when I hear these or worse reactions about “ADHD” instead of support. I worry that such words spoken by others could lead to harmful decisions for someone else.

At present, however, I know that I won’t let people and their opinions on these topics bring me down. They can think whatever they want. It won’t hurt me anymore. Even though I fight my demons every day and nobody sees how difficult life with “ADHD” is. I have finally reached a point where I am starting to love myself as I am. Nevertheless, please consider your reactions to health or neurologic problems when you don’t understand them. It could have consequences.
