# ADHD

### Hook

<mark>When I receive reactions to the word **“<ins>ADHD</ins>”**, I feel as a liar, a fake, and a fool all at once.</mark>

<del>Whenever I mention **‘<ins>ADHD</ins>’** to who knows nothing about, their reactions are quite dismissive and ignorant, filled with misconceptions and stereotypes.</del>

### Thesis Statement

The unjustified reactions and misunderstandings surrounding **“<ins>ADHD</ins>”** create an atmosphere of stigma, making individuals with ADHD feel like they have to defend themselves and battle against misconceptions.

### The Whys

We approach problems equipped with our own set of experiences, perspective, and skills. It’s <del>extremely challenging</del> <ins>a struggle</ins> to step outside of our own perspective when communicating with others, but it’s <del>increasingly</del> essential to do so.

The amount of available knowledge in our field (or any field <del>really</del>) is growing larger, more complex, and more segmented all the time. That everyone has downloaded the same fundamental knowledge on any topic is becoming less and less probable. Because of this, we have to be careful not to make too many assumptions in our documentation, blog posts, tutorials, <del>wikis,</del> and communications.

Imagine yourself explaining a particular task to an earlier version of yourself. Once upon a time, you didn’t know what you know now. Provide context. The beauty of [hypertext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext) is that we’re able to <del>quickly</del> add much-needed context<ins>, fast. It’s</ins> helpful for <del>n00bs</del> <ins>newbies</ins> but easy enough for those already in-the-know to scan over. And making documentation more human-readable benefits everyone.

### Conclusion

At present, however, I know that I won’t let people and their opinions on these topics bring me down. They can think whatever they want. It won’t hurt me anymore. Even though I fight my demons every day and nobody sees how difficult life with **“<ins>ADHD</ins>”** is. I have finally reached a point where I am starting to love myself as I am. Nevertheless, please consider your reactions to health or neurologic problems when you don’t understand them. It could have consequences.

### Takeaway

A takeaway is the importance of empathy and understanding when discussing or reacting to health or neurological conditions. It is crucial for people to refrain from making assumptions, judgments, or dismissive comments without proper knowledge or understanding. The emotions and experiences shared in my texts highlight the potential harm that can come from negative reactions and the need for support and acceptance of our limitations.
