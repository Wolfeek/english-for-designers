# ADHD

### Hook

<mark>When I receive reactions to the word **“<ins>ADHD</ins>”**, I feel as a liar, a fake, and a fool all at once.</mark>

<del>Whenever I mention **‘<ins>ADHD</ins>’** to who knows nothing about, their reactions are quite dismissive and ignorant, filled with misconceptions and stereotypes.</del>

### Thesis Statement

The unjustified reactions and misunderstandings surrounding **“<ins>ADHD</ins>”** create an atmosphere of stigma, making individuals with ADHD feel like they have to defend themselves and battle against misconceptions.

### The Whys

**Different types of <ins>“ADHD”</ins>:**

Even we, people with **“<ins>ADHD</ins>”** (or <ins>ADD</ins>), don’t judge someone with the same diagnosis solely based on our own experiences. Just because something doesn’t trouble us, doesn’t mean it doesn’t trouble someone else with the same diagnosis. There isn’t just one type of **“<ins>ADHD</ins>”**. Each of us has a unique range or combination of symptoms, and as a result, a unique level of difficulty in life. Someone may have a mild form, while someone else may have a severe form. I know someone who ended up in a mental institution due to a lack of diagnosis, and without strong medication for their **“<ins>ADHD</ins>”**, they would still be there today.

**People and their opinions / reactions on <ins>“ADHD”</ins>:** 

Whenever I mention **“<ins>ADHD</ins>”** to someone who knows nothing about it (which is most people who are not affected by it, but sadly even some family members of people with <ins>ADHD</ins>), their reactions are quite similar: **“Again - the three letters.”** (which I don’t understand, there are actually four letters). **“It’s just a trend now. Everyone seems to have it.”** **“Such a thing does not exist. Only children have it. You'd grow out of it. You can’t have it if you are a girl or a woman”** (We even hear these mystifications from certain not very educated psychiatrists during our attempts at diagnosis.)

**Empathy to humans with health or neurological problems:** 

People should consider their reactions to healthy or neurologic problems when they don’t understand them. It could have consequences… I worry that such words spoken by others could lead to harmful decisions for someone else.

### Conclusion

At present, however, I know that I won’t let people and their opinions on these topics bring me down. They can think whatever they want. It won’t hurt me anymore. Even though I fight my demons every day and nobody sees how difficult life with **“<ins>ADHD</ins>”** is. I have finally reached a point where I am starting to love myself as I am. Nevertheless, please consider your reactions to health or neurologic problems when you don’t understand them. It could have consequences.

### Takeaway

A takeaway is the importance of empathy and understanding when discussing or reacting to health or neurological conditions. It is crucial for people to refrain from making assumptions, judgments, or dismissive comments without proper knowledge or understanding. The emotions and experiences shared in my texts highlight the potential harm that can come from negative reactions and the need for support and acceptance of our limitations.
