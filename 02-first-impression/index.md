**Hi there! I’m Martina. A graphic designer and illustrator. I live in Prague.**

My educational journey started at the Business Academy. After that, I pursued my education in Graphic Design at the Higher Professional School of Visual Communication - Scholastica. This path eventually led me to the College of Creative Communication, where I further expanded skills and knowledge. My work has changed a lot throughout my journey. Every school has influenced me in some way. Just like the others. That's why we are each unique. We all have a different path. I believe that unique experiences shape us. Everyone has their own journey. 

Currently, I mainly focus on print design (DTP) and visual identities. Each project is slightly different. It all depends on the specific requirements. Recently, I have been diving deeper into typography, typesetting, and book design. I think, that design should be simple and clear. The right color can add finesse to visual part of design. 

Interestingly, prior to starting at VŠKK, I believed I was more inclined towards web design. However, I realized that my best outputs were in print materials. And it’s also what I enjoy the most. It may be due to my love for books. I love book and book design too. I adore books. I even had the opportunity to work at a bookstore for half of year. I found there my passion for book design. You could say it drew me in.

(Despite studying of Graphic Design) I find myself drawn towards hands-on work such as: drawing, painting, paper-cut illustration, lithography etc. For this reason, I want to obtaining a teaching qualification. I would like to teach art lessons at a Primary Art School.

## Featured Projects

I chose these projects because they best describe what I want to be as a graphic designer.

### Featured Project 1 Visual identity - dog shelter Libeň

<!-- Use a static poster image or animated GIF, but no video files. Again, keep the image width/height manageable, around 1280x x 720px (16:9 aspect ratio), or a max-width of 1280px. -->

- I created this project as my final assignment at the Higher Professional School of Visual Communication - **Scholastica**. It involved creating a visual identity, which included designing a logo along with a logo manual, design of merchandise products, SoMe and a website. Thanks to this project, I earned the title **“Dis.”**

- I chose this project probably because I have a dog from a shelter.

- In the final version of the logo, I took inspiration a dog’s nose.Those who have a dog may have noticed that a content dog has dog lips more of volume. Finally, I created the main part of the snout into a heart shape. I chose yellow-orange as the main color - for its positive energy and symbolism. The secondary colors were white and, if anybody need use text - black (for text). Unfortunately, the project was not realized as the shelter did not communicate with me.

<!-- Use the same stucture above for the rest of your featured projects. -->

<!-- Use a static poster image or animated GIF, but no video files. Again, keep the image width/height manageable, around 1280x x 720px (16:9 aspect ratio), or a max-width of 1280px. -->

- This assignment was given to us as part of the main subject (of graphic design specialization) at **the College of Creative Communication**. It was a real project. The connection was by **the Creative Office** of the college. It was group's work. Originally it should be just lifting of logo with change of visual identity, but more groups did redesign.

- I worked on this project together with Honza Honys. We started with lifting of logo, building upon the original logo and making improvements. We then changed the color scheme, focusing on more appealing shades. We defined two types of fonts. The playful font type was used only for the main headings (with alternating colors for each glyph in the heading). The second font was used for regular text and subheadings (which were in purple). We worked with photo (portrait)cropping and puzzle effects in the defined colors. The most dominant colors were white and ochre (yellow). For website links, we used a blue QR code. Regarding business cards, we had two types: one for the school and another for specific individuals. Additionally, we also worked on designs for SoMe (social media) and textbook covers.

### Featured Project 3 LOGO AND WEBSITE DESIGN

<!-- Use a static poster image or animated GIF, but no video files. Again, keep the image width/height manageable, around 1280x x 720px (16:9 aspect ratio), or a max-width of 1280px. -->

- I did this project at internship - at **DURT DESIGN**. It was about creating logo for czech slalomer **Jiří Vašina**.

- I created symbol from **"J"** as paddle with wave. The most important part - **the last name** - I placed behind the symbol. I did this because in the case of sports people is more important the last name than the full name.

- This collaboration also led to the design of the website, which was finalized by a web designer. Later on, I also created a presentation for **Jiří Vašina** (and for **Tereza Neumannová** - professional cyclist) to showcase to their sponsors.

- I use three colors - dark blue, light blue and pink. I also use the semicolon as dominant element (to cover of book and title page). I work with different system of numbering of pages (in pink color). The footnotes of the book was more dominanted than is normal (in blue color). And I was working with so many things, that it would be for a long time.

- I created two cover design of books in the edition. The thing that is changing is one of the three colors + and the same color is changed in footnotes.
